Here is the rewritten README with the project name changed to **GravAI** and all Polygon references replaced with **Linera** (a real-time Layer-1 blockchain using microchains for ultra-low latency, high scalability, parallel execution, and sub-second finality at virtually unlimited scale).

# **GravAI**

## **Overview**

**GravAI** is an AI-powered, real-time on-chain analytics and fundraising intelligence dashboard built natively on **Linera**.

It provides:

* Instant transaction feeds
* DeFi yield tracking
* Wallet monitoring
* Anomaly detection
* VC-pattern matching insights

All delivered with Linera’s real-time performance, sub-second finality, and elastic scalability via microchains.

With a degen-styled **Next.js + Tailwind** interface, GravAI converts raw on-chain activity into actionable alpha for AI + Crypto builders — enabling them to showcase investor-ready metrics (TVL growth, user traction, yield efficiency) and raise capital faster on the most scalable, real-time blockchain designed for agentic and high-throughput Web3 applications.

*(Update the deployment URL in your repo when re-deployed on Linera)*

## The smart contract successfully built and deployed to the Mainnet. The contract is live at 0xd9aC52cCaD325f96398A06ADad409B30b3768d24
*(Note: If redeploying to Linera mainnet, update this address accordingly)*

## **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**

* **Next.js (App Router)** + TypeScript
* **Tailwind CSS** – degen aesthetic
* **Chart.js + Framer Motion** – smooth charts & animations

### **Linera Stack**

* Linera **microchains** architecture for parallel, user-dedicated chains
* **Viem + Wagmi** for chain interaction (with Linera provider support)
* **RainbowKit** – plug-and-play wallet connect
* **Ethers.js** – log parsing & ABI decoding (adapt as needed for Linera SDK)

### **Real-Time & AI**

* Linera **native notifications** + RPC polling fallback
* Lightweight **on-chain/off-chain AI models** for:

  * Summarization
  * Anomaly detection

## **Getting Started**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourteam/gravai.git
cd gravai
npm install

cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Linera RPC URL / node endpoint + WalletConnect Project ID (or equivalent)

npm run dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**, connect your wallet to Linera → **instant alpha**.

*(Note: Update repo name, env vars, and chain config for Linera integration — check Linera docs for client setup and microchain support.)*

## **Roadmap**

### ✅ **Current (Buildathon Submission)**

* Real-time analytics + AI insights
* Fundraising intelligence engine
* Gamified UI
* Developer dashboard (`/nerds`)

### 🚀 **Next**
