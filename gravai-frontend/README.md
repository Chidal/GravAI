# **AIScan**

## **Overview**

**AIScan** is an AI-powered, real-time on-chain analytics and fundraising intelligence dashboard built natively on **Aleo**.

It provides:

* Instant private transaction feeds
* DeFi yield tracking
* Wallet monitoring
* Anomaly detection
* VC-pattern matching insights

All delivered with Aleo’s strong privacy guarantees, ultra-low fees, and instant finality.

With a degen-styled **Next.js + Tailwind** interface, AIScan converts raw on-chain activity into actionable alpha for AI + Crypto builders — enabling them to showcase investor-ready metrics (TVL growth, user traction, yield efficiency) privately and raise capital faster on the leading zero-knowledge L1 blockchain.
